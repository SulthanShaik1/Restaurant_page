# 🍽️ HungryNow – Restaurant Listing Web App  
**Built with React + TypeScript + Vite**

This is a clean and simple restaurant listing web application that I created for the **Binaried Technologies technical assignment**.  
The app shows restaurants, allows searching, filtering, and opens a modal to view more details.  
I kept the UI minimal, fast, and easy to use.
